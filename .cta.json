I've fixed a critical bug in the streaming response handling that was corrupting the generated code.

The issue was in `src/routes/index.tsx`, where the streaming logic:
1.  Failed to buffer incomplete JSON chunks.
2.  Had a catch block that incorrectly appended the raw, unparsed chunk to the code output whenever a parse error occurred (which happens frequently when a JSON object is split across chunks).

This resulted in code corruption, duplicate segments, and raw JSON leaking into the editor (e.g., `justifyCohy` or missing `sx` props).

I refactored the streaming loop to:
- Use a persistent buffer for incoming data.
- Only process complete lines (splitting by newline).
- Safely handle JSON parsing errors without corrupting the output.

This should result in clean, valid code generation.
